# Math Snake Game
A math based snake game, additional to the classic snake game, you have a question based on divisibility and the answer lies in one of the 3 apples on the map. Eating the right apple increments your score while eating the wrong one decrements it.
Everytime you eat an apple, your length increases by one and your speed increases. Colliding with the boundaries or the rock in the map leads to instant loss. Eating a wrong answer more than 3 times leads to a loss.
Enjoy
